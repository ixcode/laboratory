* Laboratory 

A virtualised laboratory that allows you to experiment with distributed systems right from your laptop.

* Preparation

You need a few things before you can run the lab.

** OSX

- Virtual Box
- Vagrant
- Homebrew
- Ansible `brew install ansible`

- `pip install passlib`

- use the mkpasswd utility

mkpasswd --method=SHA-512

The password for the image is "changeme" make sure you change it!

# yum -y groups install "GNOME Desktop" 

# startx 

I needed to install the virtual box 5 guest additions but then it was fine. Unfortunately virtualbox 5 is not supported by vagrant and so I had to then downgrade virtual box but the guest additions still work!

To turn off cowsay
export ANSIBLE_NOCOWS=1
